# About

1. This slide deck was written in HTML.
2. The slides themselves were written in Markdown incorporated into the HTML file.
3. The slides you are seeing are rendered using remark.js <https://remarkjs.com/downloads/remark-latest.min.js>

# Question
To display our slides on a web browser, we appended the URL for this HTML file to http://htmlpreview.github.com/?.
      
      Is there a better way to preview HTML from within GitHub?
